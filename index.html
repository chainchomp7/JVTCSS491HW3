<div><b>Collision Interaction.</b> "Enemies" Follow closely towards the "leader" Jerry, the gray-haired boy.
<br>When Jerry touches an enemy's inner box (Dino, Snowman, Duck) while "alive", he will become knocked back and become a ghost, 
and his speed will increase. <br>As a ghost, Jerry cannot be knocked back in this state, though enemies will 
still attempt to follow. Enemies' larger outer boxes will attempt to make other <br>enemies be pushed away from each other.
"Healer" components (small boy and 3 top-like machines) will restore him back if he touches one.
<br>All objects' outer boxes are pushed away from walls. Healers can go through other objects besides walls.
<br>Outer boxes are green. Enemy inner boxes are red. Jerry and Healers' boxes are blue.</div>
